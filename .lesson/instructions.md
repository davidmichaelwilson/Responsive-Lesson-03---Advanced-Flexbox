In this lesson, you will unpack the shortcut that `flex: 1` provides.
In reality, three attributes are combined into `flex`: `flex-grow`, 
`flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. 

In part 1, modify these three attributes so that the middle column
is twice the size of the other two columns. Other properties should
be assigned their default values.

In part 2, modify the attributes so that the middle column does
not shrink below 200px in width while the other columns can
shrink to 0 width.

In part 3, make the middle column start at a width of 250px
when the other columns have a width of 0.

All of the attributes you need to change have been given a value
of `-1` to help you distinguish which values to focus on. Good luck!
